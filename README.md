# Personal Job Tracker

I need a job but I also find it hard to keep track of which step I am for which company in the hiring process so I made this app to help keep track of that. If you like the app and think someone like me could be of use to your operation, please send me an email. 

## Getting Started

```yarn install``` will download all necesarry files for you
You'll want to create your own remote MongoDB
Place that a .env file which DB_URI as the key
```yarn start``` will start the Electron app and the React app at the same time.  
I'm also including my .vscode launch config as I found it helpful. You don't need ```yarn start``` if you're using that.


## Deployment

```yarn build``` will package everything neatly for you
